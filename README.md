# Extracting Kobo Notes

Code for extracting annotations from Kobo E-readers and outputting them in Markdown format. 
Originated from [this blog post](https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/33-epub_annotation_export/).
Using a tool such as `pandoc`, you can convert Markdown files effortlessly to html, pdf and many other formats.


I wrote this quickly for my own use and it's really just a first quick hack. 
You'll find some `TODOs` in the code ;-).
Use code at your own risk and see [the license](./LICENSE).
Somewhere in the future I'll work a bit on this repo, but in the meantime I upload the code here because several people have kindly requested me to do so.

Suggestions, issues, fixes etc. are welcomed.

Note that the current script only takes a single file as an argument.
You probably want to adjust it to extract notes in batch.
