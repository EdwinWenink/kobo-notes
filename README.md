# Extracting Kobo Annotations

Code for extracting annotations from Kobo E-readers and outputting them in Markdown format. 
Originated from [this blog post](https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/33-epub_annotation_export/).
For a brief guide, have a look [here](https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/53-update_kobo_annotation/).

Using a tool such as `pandoc`, you can convert Markdown files effortlessly to html, pdf and many other formats.

I wrote this quickly for my own use, use at your own risk and see [the license](./LICENSE).
You'll find some `TODOs` in the code ;-).

Suggestions, issues, fixes etc. are welcomed.
